Parse::CPAN::Packages::Fast
---------------------------

Interface to CPAN's package index file.

This is a reimplementation of the existing Parse::CPAN::Packages
module. It tries to be largely API compatible while being notably
faster.

To install, do

    cpan .

or if CPAN.pm is too old or not configured correctly, do alternatively

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Send suggestions, bug reports etc. to Slaven Rezic (srezic at cpan dot
org).
